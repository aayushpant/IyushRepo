All my learning resources, projects are stored here

Though I have been a member of GitHub since 2015, i haven't created a repo and pushed anything on it.
I was using Tortoise svn in my first work as a central repo.
So, I have created my first repo and pushed my code from my local machine to this repo.
This is amazing and now i regret why did'nt i do it at the time when i signed up for github.
